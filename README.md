# JellyFysh/ParaSpheres code

This code project is associated with the paper "Multithreaded event-chain Monte
Carlo with local times", Botao Li, Synge Todo, A. C. Maggs, Werner Krauth
(see [Li2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11040) in [References.bib](References.bib)).

## Installing

The code project is written in Fortran 90, C++, Python, as well as shell.
The following steps are required for running and testing the code, namely:

* Creating initial configurations of hard spheres.
* Creating the constraint graph that is used in the simulations.
* Running reference simulations with variable numbers of threads in order to
validate the multithreaded algorithm.
* Running the multithreaded code in Validate and Benchmark modes.

All programs can be compiled and run individually. For ease of use, driver scripts are provided
in the `Scripts/` directory. Use of scripts ensures that output is placed
in a new directory, in the `Run/` directory tree. The scripts also suggest consistent options
for all the programs. The scripts also create symbolic links to the starting
data and initialization files.

## Running tests

The user should switch to the `Scripts` directory (`cd Scripts` on Linux) and
run from within this directory, then examine the results in subdirectories of
the  `Run/` directory. Each script creates a unique subdirectory.

## Using JellyFysh/ParaSpheres

Use of the programs requires firstly running `Setup.sh` in the `Scripts` directory, 
in order to create the starting data files, which are placed in `SetupData/`. 
(Please check [The general instruction of running scripts](Scripts/README.md) and 
[The detailed description of `Setup.sh`](Scripts/README.md#setupsh).)
Other scripts can be run
in any order. The `SystemDimension` variable must be set to the same value
in each script, the default value is `SystemDimension=256` which is the standard value
used in the paper.


The directory `Fortran90/Historic/`, contains code
authored by Etienne P. Bernard, who kindly contributed the
programs used in the paper "Two-Step Melting in Two
Dimensions: First-Order Liquid-Hexatic Transition", Etienne P. Bernard and
Werner Krauth (see [Bernard2011](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.155704)
or [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4094)).
